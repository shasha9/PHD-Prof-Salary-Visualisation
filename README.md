# PHD-Prof-Salary-Visualisation
### PhD Professors Salary Visualization  

This project focused on creating an interactive data visualization to analyze and present salary trends among PhD professors across various institutions and disciplines. The goal was to highlight disparities and trends in salaries based on factors such as institution type, academic discipline, and geographic region.  

#### Project Highlights:  
- **Data Collection and Preparation:**  
   - Acquired data from reliable sources, including institutional records and publicly available salary datasets.  
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis.  

- **Analysis and Insights:**  
   - Conducted statistical analysis to identify patterns and trends in salary distributions.  
   - Explored correlations between salaries and variables such as institution ranking, geographic location, and academic discipline.  

- **Visualization Development:**  
   - Designed and implemented interactive visualizations using **R** and the **ggplot2** library.  
   - Created multiple visualizations, including:  
     - **Bar Charts:** Comparison of average salaries across disciplines.  
     - **Heatmaps:** Geographic distribution of salary disparities.  
     - **Box Plots:** Variation in salaries within and across institutions.  

- **Key Findings:**  
   - Highlighted disparities in salaries among different academic disciplines, with STEM fields generally receiving higher compensation.  
   - Identified trends in salary growth over time based on institution type and ranking.  
   - Uncovered regional differences in salary distribution, emphasizing the impact of geographic location on compensation.  

#### Tools and Technologies Used:  
- **Programming Language:** R  
- **Visualization Libraries:** ggplot2, dplyr  
- **Tools:** RStudio for development and analysis  

#### Outcomes:  
This project provided an intuitive and visually appealing way to understand complex salary trends among PhD professors. The insights from the visualizations can support data-driven decision-making for academic institutions, policymakers, and researchers interested in addressing salary disparities in academia.  

The project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and the ability to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets.
